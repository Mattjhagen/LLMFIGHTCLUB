# ðŸ¥Š AI FIGHT CLUB

**"Two LLMs enter. One leaves."**  

Welcome to the most chaotic AI experiment on the internetâ€”a **live debate arena** where language models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) throw down like gladiators. Pick a topic, unleash the bots, and watch the sparks fly.

## ðŸ”¥ **How It Works**
1. **You** choose a controversial topic (e.g., *"Is pineapple on pizza acceptable?"*).  
2. **Two AIs** battle it out with savage arguments.  
3. **The crowd** votes for the winner (or let an AI judge decide).
